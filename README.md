# Building Ethereum Mining Rigs

I built this project in my basement at home - it involved assembling custom frames, installing multiple GPUs, configuring motherboards, and setting up mining software. Here is a step by step process on how I built and set up Ethereum mining rigs. By the end of this project, I managed to set up 5 mining rigs using over 20 GPUs in total.



**Goal:** Construct as many Ethereum mining rigs as possible while splitting the AMD and NVDIA GPUs.

**Tools Needed:**
- Allen wrenches
- Screwdrivers 
- GPU risers
- Frame materials (aluminum or steel)
- Power supplies
- Motherboards
- GPUs
- Ethernet cables
- Mining software (e.g., NiceHash, Ethminer)

**Hardware Components:**
- GPUs: Various models including NVIDIA and AMD
- Motherboards: Each capable of supporting multiple GPUs
- Power Supplies: 1200W and above for optimal power distribution
- Frames: Custom-built based on the number of GPUs to hold 

## Step 1: Planning and Design

### Frame Construction
I started by designing and building custom frames for holding the GPUs. The framework was constructed from aluminum for its lightweight and strong characteristics. Each frame was customized because I needed to hold the exact amount of gpus I had of each brand.

### Hardware Selection
Choosing the right components was crutical for optimal mining performance and efficiency. I opted for a combination of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs due to their high performance in mining tasks. Each motherboard was selected based on the number of GPU slots and compatibility with other components.

## Step 2: Assembling the Hardware

### Setting Up the Motherboards
Each motherboard was set up with the CPU, RAM, and storage before attaching it to the frame. BIOS settings were adjusted to run the best software for the specific mining gpu.

### Installing GPUs
GPUs were mounted on the frame using secure brackets and connected to the motherboards using PCIe risers. This helps in reducing heat accumulation and allows easier access for maintenance or for switching out GPUs

## Step 3: Electrical and Power Setup

### Power Supply Installation
High-wattage power supplies were installed to ensure each component receives adequate power. Proper distribution and cable management were crucial to avoid overheating and electrical hazards.

### Connectivity
Ethernet cables were used to connect each rig to the internet for blockchain access. This setup is crucial for mining operations as it involves frequent data exchanges with the Ethereum network.

## Step 4: Software Installation and Configuration

### Mining Software
For the mining software, I chose Ethminer due to its compatibility with Ethereum. Each rig was configured with unique worker IDs to monitor performance and troubleshooting.

### System Optimization
The final step involved system tweaks to optimize mining performance. This included overclocking GPUs, tuning system cooling, and configuring auto-start settings in case of system reboots.

## Challenges Faced

During this project, several challenges I encountered included:
- Overheating issues which were mitigated by optimizing the frame design for better air circulation.
- Hardware compatibility issues, especially with different GPU models which required firmware updates and BIOS tweaks.

## Conclusion

This project not only taught me about the technical aspects of setting up Ethereum mining rigs but also about the importance of careful planning and ongoing maintenance. The rigs have been operational and effectively mining Ethereum, contributing to the Ethereum network while also providing a source of passive income.
